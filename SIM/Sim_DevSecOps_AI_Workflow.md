Goal: Build an automated AI workflow that performs security analysis on every GitHub Pull Request and posts a summarized report back as a PR comment.

---

Workflow Steps:

1. Setup Trigger:

- Configure GitHub Pull Request trigger
- Events:
  - opened
  - synchronize
  - reopened

- Ensure webhook is registered with the repository

---

2. Extract PR Data:
From webhook payload:
- Repository owner
- Repository name
- Pull Request number

---

3. Fetch Changed Files:
- Use GitHub API:
GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/files

- Authentication:
    - Retrieve GitHub PAT securely from workspace secrets
    - Example: GITHUB_TOKEN

- For each file:
   - Filename
   - Patch (diff)
   - Status (added/modified/removed)

- Skip:
    - Binary files
    - Files exceeding size threshold
---

4. AI Security Analysis:
Analyze each changed file for:

- Hardcoded secrets (API keys, tokens, credentials)
- Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, command, etc.)
- Unsafe deserialization
- Authentication/authorization flaws
- Sensitive data leaks
- OWASP Top 10 risks

For each issue, produce:

- Severity (Low / Medium / High / Critical)
- Description
- Affected snippet (from diff)
- Recommended fix

---

5. Aggregate Results:

- Total issues by severity
- File-wise breakdown
- Highlight critical/high issues

----

6. Generate PR Comment (Markdown):
### 🔐 AI Security Scan Report

Summary:

- Critical: X
- High: X
- Medium: X
- Low: X


**Findings:**
- File: <filename>
   - Issue: <description>
   - Severity: <level>
   - Recommendation: <fix>


**Overall Recommendation:**

- ✅ Approve
- ⚠️ Needs Fixes
- ❌ Block Merge

---

7. Post Comment to PR:
- GitHub API:
  POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{pull_number}/comments

- Authentication:
  - Use GitHub PAT from workspace secrets (GITHUB_TOKEN)
  - Do NOT hardcode or expose the token

---

Constraints:
- Never expose secrets in logs or outputs
- Ensure idempotency (avoid duplicate comments)
- Handle large PRs efficiently
- Respect API rate limits

---

Output: 
"Security scan completed and comment posted successfully."
